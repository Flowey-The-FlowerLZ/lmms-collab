# lmms-collab
Trying to create a musical collaboration in a way nobody did before.
For those who don't know, this is meant to be a proof-of-concept repository. Please don't take it seriously until you feel you should.

A few important things if you want to contribute:
- Only use instruments/effects that are included in LMMS 1.2.2 stable. No VST or anything like that.
- You can use factory samples as long as their location/filename is not changed.
- Please don't use global automations or any black-magic. It's better for everyone.
- Save your project file as uncompressed .mmp, so it will be easier to manage.

Let's make music!
